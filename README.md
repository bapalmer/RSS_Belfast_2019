**Data FAIRification using R/RStudio workflows**

## Summary
As funders seek ways in which the visible research outputs from their support can be maximised, adoption of open science practises are increasingly forming part of emerging funding calls. However, there is little guidance on how to implement these tools, and researchers can be intimidated by the complexity of choice and the multitude of options.

In this session, a demonstration of an R/Rstudio workflow, that includes the steps needed to assemble and package research data in a manner that adheres to FAIR data principles, will be presented.

The session is aimed at researchers with a working knowledge of R/RStudio. Using a broadly applicable example workflow, we will take you through the ‘FAIRification’ of a real life yet simple sample data set. We will finish by demonstrating the final packaging of the research project through the creation of a Binder RStudio instance.
